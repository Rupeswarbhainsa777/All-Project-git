# Portfolio | Architecture of Code

A premium, monochrome portfolio website designed with a structural, architectural aesthetic. This project moves away from standard tech-gradients to a cleaner, high-editorial style focusing on typography, grid systems, and negative space.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Monochrome Palette:** Strict black & white color scheme for a timeless, gallery-like presentation.
- **Architectural Layout:** Rigid grid systems and bold typography (Space Grotesk & Inter).
- **Premium Feel:** Micro-interactions and smooth transitions that feel substantive and precise.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Live GitHub Integration:** Automatically fetches and displays your profile stats (Repos, Followers, Following) and latest repositories using the GitHub API.
- **Dynamic Project Filtering:** Filter projects by category (Web, Data, General) without page reloads.
- **Responsive Architecture:** A layout that adapts fluidly from wide-screen desktops to mobile devices while maintaining its structural integrity.
- **Performance:** Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum speed and no build-step complexity.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom variables, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and backdrop-filters.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Async/Await for API fetching, DOM manipulation for filtering.
